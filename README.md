# My_Alexa

A Python-based voice assistant inspired by Alexa, capable of recognizing voice commands, opening websites, fetching news, and performing various tasks with minimal latency. This project demonstrates speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and API integration in Python.

- Features:
Wake Word Detection: Activates upon hearing the wake word "Alexa."
Web Browsing: Opens popular websites like Google, Facebook, YouTube, and more based on voice commands.
News Headlines: Fetches the latest news using the NewsAPI and reads them aloud.

Dynamic Responses: Provides feedback for unrecognized commands or errors.
Text-to-Speech: Converts responses to speech using gTTS and plays them using pygame.
